This is the first stand-alone release of Ant, several older versions
have been included with Tomcat builds and been referred to as Ant
"1.0.8" by some people. Therefore the release number has been chosen
to be 1.1 instead of 1.0.

Ant 1.1 can probably not be built with an older version of Ant, please
use the bootstrap script to build it from the source release. 

The binary release doesn't contain the optional tasks - compiled
versions of those are distributed in a separate file: optional.jar.

Build files written for older versions of Ant are expected to work
(with one exception - see below) but could generate deprecation
warnings. Future versions of Ant may remove these deprecated features.

Properties are now immutable, this means constructs like

<property name="longproperty" value="value1" />
<property name="longproperty" value="${longproperty}value2" />

won't work any longer. Properties defined on the command line and
Java's system properties can not be overridden by <property> tags
inside the buildfile.

  Thanks for using Ant.
